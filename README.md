# CSharpEducation601

> An educational, multi-database supported WinForms application built on a layered architecture

This project is a sample desktop application developed within the scope of the **C# Education Camp**. The main purpose of the project is to practically learn and reinforce modern software development approaches such as the **C# programming language**, **layered architecture**, **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, and **multi-database integration**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application is a **WinForms (Windows Forms)** project designed for educational purposes to model real-world desktop application architectures. It includes the following core structures:

- Layered architecture approach  
- Entity classes  
- Service layer  
- MongoDB database integration  
- PostgreSQL database integration  
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations  
- Form-based user interface
